# React Todo List Application

This repository contains a Todo List Application created as part of IBM's Developing Front-End Apps with React course.

### Course Information
Title: Developing Front-End Apps with React
Type: Hands-on Lab
Course Provider: IBM

### Objective

- Using an event handler to create and add a todo task.
- Deleting completed tasks from the todo list using the filter method.
- Adding a toggle function and checkbox to mark tasks as completed or not completed.
- Editing an added Todo task and submitting changes using the map function.
- Utilizing the useEffect hook to save new todos into local storage for persistence.

The store management with redux has 3 main components:

Actions - These are blocks of information that send data from your application to your store. Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.

Reducers - Reducers specify how the applicationâ€™s state changes in response to actions sent to the store.

Store - The Store is the object that brings the action and reducer together. The store has the following responsibilities: holds application state, allows access to state, allows state to be updated via dispatch(action).
